# Dynamic-Screenshots

This script, when run after adjusting and filling in the credentials in the script, will login for the user, and go to a certain page within the site and 
continuously take screenshots (dynamically resizing the page to take full screenshots of the entire page), and automatically press the next button. This 
script was designed for a certain website that was of use to me, however it is up to the end user to format this script for his/her needs.
